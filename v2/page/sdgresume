        I am but a passionate middle school student who has a keen interest in coding, I started at the early age of 4. I've has spent countless hours learning various programming languages and has become proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. My coding journey began when I stumbled upon ScratchJr on my mother's iPad and was fascinated by the idea of building animations and games in ScratchJr using colorful blocks. Since then, I has been fully immersed in the world of coding, constantly looking for new challenges to solve. My motivation for coding lies in my fascination with how technology has the power to change the world and the idea of creating projects with simply text. I believe that coding is a powerful tool that can be used to solve real-world problems and I hope to use my skills to make a positive impact in society. In the future, I aspire to become a computer scientist and work in the field of artifical intelligence which allows me to create innovative solutions to complex problems. I plan to continue my coding journey and learn more advanced programming languages to expand my skill set and stay at the forefront of technological advancements.
